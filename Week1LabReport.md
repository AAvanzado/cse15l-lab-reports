# Week 1 Lab Report

The following is a tutorial about how to log into a course-specific account on "ieng6"

# 1. Installing VScode
* Firstly, visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for the download links
* Then download Visual Studio Code on based on whatever device you are using (OSX for Macs, Windows for PCs, etc)
* Lastly, open VScode, making sure that it works on your device

# 2. Remotely Connecting
* If you are using a mac, there is nothing more you need to install
* Open the terminal on your device (Ctrl or Command + \` ) and enter `ssh ###***@ieng6.ucsd.edu `
  where ### is the name of your class and quarter (e.g. cs15lwi23) and *** replaced with the letters unique to your course account
* If this is your first time logging in then you will be asked if you want to continue connecting to which you will enter "yes", followed by entering your password for the account

# 3. Trying Some Commands
* Test out some simple commands such as `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, and `cp`
* Your class directory will typically be `/home/linux/ieng6/***` where *** is the name of your class and quarter (e.g. cs15lwi23)
* In order to exit the terminal use either Ctrl + D or run the command `exit`
